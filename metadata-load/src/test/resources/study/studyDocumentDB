            <STUDY_DESCRIPTION>This study&apos;s purpose is to use data generated in whole genome and exome Breast Cancer sequencing to target specific areas in multiple other Breast Cancer samples. These areas will then be subjected to PCR in multiple cases, tagged and then pool the resultant amplicons. These amplicons will then be sequenced on the Illumina GAII. This is hoped to show the prevalence of previous findings in multiple individuals in a high throughput method.</STUDY_DESCRIPTION>

            <STUDY_ABSTRACT>All cancers arise due to somatically acquired mutations in their genomes which alter the function of key cancer genes. Understanding the critical mutational events underlying the development of cancer is paramount for advancing prevention, early detection and effective treatment of the disease. Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women. Extraordinary recent advances in sequencing now make it a realistic aim to sequence large numbers of breast cancer genomes to find somatic mutations on a massive scale.</STUDY_ABSTRACT>
